## Usage

To use the CoinRepresentation class in your C# project, simply include the CoinRepresentation.cs file and call the Solve method with the desired sum as the argument. Ensure that the necessary using directives are included in your code.

Example:

```csharp
using System;
using CoinRepresentation;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        long sum = 10;
        long ways = CoinRepresentation.Solve(sum);
        Console.WriteLine($"Number of ways to represent {sum} using coins: {ways}");
    }
}
